This is whatmon
===============

whatmon is a tiny Firefox and Thunderbird extension or add-on, which can
monitor almost anything you wish to monitor. Number of logged on users? Current
load average?  Health of your LDAP servers? Mail server queues? No problem for
whatmon, as long as you can create a CGI program in Perl, C, or any other
language you are comfortable with, or even a PHP or Active-Whatever script
which runs on your web server and can produce a wee bit of XML. There is one
thing that whatmon cannot reliably watch: the web server from which it
retrieves that XML ... :-)
